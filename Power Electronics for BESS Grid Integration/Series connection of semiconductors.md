For direct connection to the medium-voltage ac grid, many two- or three-level converter topologies can still be utilized.multiple IGBTs are connected in series, as a single IGBT with a voltage rating of a few kilovolts (e.g., 1.7–6.5 kV) is unable to block the required dc-link voltage.

## Pro 

## Cons
-  this approach include implications for the converters’ physical construction with many series-connected switching devices, and specific design of the gate driver/semiconductors to ensure each device is synchronously turned on/off. The use of this topology also necessitates a low switching frequency to achieve acceptable switching losses, which, in turn, implies a higher cost of output filters.
