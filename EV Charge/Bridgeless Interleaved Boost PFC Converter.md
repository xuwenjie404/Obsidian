In this topology, two diodes are replaced by active switches with anti-parallel diode. 

## Pros
- Heat dissipation issue of diode-bridge rectifier can be overcome by Bridgeless PFC topology.
- Compared to boost PFC, the efficiency is higher for this converter, as diode bridge rectifier is not present at the converter input.

## Cons
- the input line is floating, making sensing of input voltage impossible without the help of a transformer, [[Bridgeless Boost PFC Converter]] solve this problem
