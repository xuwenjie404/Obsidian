The interleaved boost converter consists of two boost converters in parallel operating with 180 deg out of phase between the two switches. The most important points of the interleaved converter are as follows:

1. In interleaving topology, if the phase shifting is present in m channels at uniform intervals, the effective ripple frequency increases m times and the current ripple magnitude decreases with the ripple cancellation at the output, which reduces stress on the output capacitors.
2. The size of the EMI filter at the input can be reduced further with asymmetrical topology. It is desirable to arrange a phase shift to an angle such that the first noise peak is not fully cancelled and the noise peak of the next higher order harmonics can be reduced. By doing so, maximum reduction in the EMI size and cost can be achieved.
3. The optimal phase shift angle can be calculated by determining the relative amount of attenuation of the first two noise peaks of interest and setting the relative amounts of cancellation to be complementary to the attenuation of the filter.
4. The power loss at the input diode bridge rectifier with the interleaved topology is the same as a conventional boost PFC which limits the power levels of this topology to 3–3.5 kW.
