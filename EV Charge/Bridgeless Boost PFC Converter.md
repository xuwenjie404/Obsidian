This bridgeless boost PFC converter solves the problem of heat management at the input diode bridge.As the name 'bridgeless' itself indicates, the topology is without a diode bridge at input.This topology is mainly classified into bridgeless, dual boost, semibridgeless and phase shifted bridgeless PFC converters. The drawbacks and the advantages for each topology are given below.


## Pros

1. This bridgeless topology is applicable for applications more than 1 kw, where power density and efficiency are important.
2. This converter solves the problem of heat management in the input rectifier diode bridge introduces an increased EMI (because the amplitude of the noise source applied to the stray capacitor from a high-voltage dc bus and power ground is much higher in a bridgeless PFC.The commonmode (CM) noise generated by a bridgeless PFC is much higher than conventional boost PFC topology.

## Cons
1. This topology is the floating input line with respect to the PFC ground, making it impossible to sense the input voltage without a low frequency transformer or an optical coupler.
2.  Current sensing is very difficult in bridgeless topologies. We can use a differential mode amplifier and current transformers to sense the input current. However, the most optimal method is the use of one cycle control.
