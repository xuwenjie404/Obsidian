Pulse width modulated (PWM) PFC converter is an active PFC converter.

In rectifier mode of operation, the operation of this converter is analogous to a conventional boost converter and inverter mode of operation is analogous to conventional buck converter.
## Pros
- unity power factor operation
- low distortion input current
- regulated dc-link voltage
- Â bi-directional power flow capability
- the dc-link filter capacitor required is of smaller size.
## Cons
- numbers of the Switches is more and costly
