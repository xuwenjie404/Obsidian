## Pros
Level 3 commercial fast charging offers the possibility of charging in less than 1 h. It can be installed in highway rest areas and city refueling points, analogous to gas stations.

typically operated with a 480 V or higher three-phase circuit and requires an off-board charger to provide regulated ac–dc conversion.

## Cons
Level 3 charging (also level 2) can increase distribution transformer losses, voltage deviations, harmonic distortion, peak demand, and thermal loading on the distribution system. This could significantly impact transformer life, reliability, security, efficiency, and economy of developing smart grids due to reduced transformer life
