Â A PFC control circuit is crucial when fed from an ac supply to improve the power quality.

For lead acid batteries, **single stage AC-DC conversion** is suitable even though there is a large low frequency ripple in the output current.

For Lithium-ion batteries  which require a low voltage ripple , **two-stage AC-DC/DC-DC** power conversion provides inherent low frequency ripple rejection.
